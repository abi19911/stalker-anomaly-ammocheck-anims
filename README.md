# stalker-anomaly-ammocheck-anims
concept animation designed for Zukuu's ammo check addon; [Moddb](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/ammocheck-rc18), [Github](https://github.com/WrkX/Stalker_Ammo_Check).

### Note
The animations are bound to have bugs as I have not tested them ingame, I'm not really familiar with lua scripting; any help is appreciated on writing a script to test my anims.

### Changelog
```
18/Feb/21
=========
 + Added ak/aks anims and audio.
 + Weapons mp5sd, and 9a91 (and their audio) have been updated. They can be considered done.
 side note: I figured out the correct way to animate the guns, hopefully things will go smoothly in coming updates :D

17/Jan/21
=========
 + Weapons 9a91, an94, and ace21 are compiled and ready to be used/tested ingame.
   \_ Audio for these weapons also have been synced.
 + The aek971 is giving me alot of trouble when trying to translate from blender into stalker's engine. Will possibly have to animate from scratch. skipping for now.

15/Jan/21
=========
 + All anims as of this date are compiled at 30fps, will change to 60fps on finished products.
 + Audio may not be synced, fine-tuning will be required.
